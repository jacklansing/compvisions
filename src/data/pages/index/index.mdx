  Learning in and beyond the classroom is the focus of Computer Visions'
  training. Effective classroom training provides increased ROI (Return on

  classes are designed to facilitate continued practice, exploration, and
  growth.

  technically proficient, but are skilled communicators. They know how to make
  novice users comfortable with technology and turn advanced users into “power
